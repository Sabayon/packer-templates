## Packer template for Sabayon

Now you can build fresh vagrant, virtualbox and VMware Sabayon images with [packer](https://packer.io/).

Download the repository and then, choose on what are you interested in:

### Vagrant

    packer build -force vagrant.json

Note: vagrant images are also available in Hashicorp's Atlas: [Sabayon/spinbase-amd64](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/Sabayon/boxes/spinbase-amd64). 

If you have Vagrant this should be straightforward:

	vagrant init Sabayon/spinbase-amd64; vagrant up --provider virtualbox

You can always download the boxes using Atlas providers link:

 *https://atlas.hashicorp.com/Sabayon/boxes/spinbase-amd64/versions/**[TAG]**/providers/virtualbox.box*

* here **[TAG]** is the box version (*e.g. v0.10 =>  https://atlas.hashicorp.com/Sabayon/boxes/spinbase-amd64/versions/0.10/providers/virtualbox.box*)


### Virtualbox

	packer build -force virtualbox.json

### VMware

	packer build -force vmware.json


## Credentials

The **root** user has the **root** password, so if you are going to deploy this image, you want to change that.
There is the user "vagrant" that can be accessed by issuing "vagrant ssh" (pubkeys are the insecure ones needed by Vagrant).
